**As a** back-end developer
**I need** to develop and enhance the application's back-end services
**So that** the system becomes robust, secure, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with the front-end
### Details and Assumptions
- The project, Second Chance, already has a basic back-end structure in place.
- The main focus is to handle business logic, database interactions, authentication, and server-side data processing.
- The back-end will connect with both existing and future front-end interfaces.
- New features will be added based on user needs and system integration requirements.
- Security, performance, and scalability are top priorities.
### Acceptance Criteria
    gherkin
    Given the basic back-end structure is already in place  
    When I develop and enhance the services according to project requirements
    Then the system should be robust, secure, scalable, and integrate seamlessly with front-end components
